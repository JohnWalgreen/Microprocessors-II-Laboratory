"Micro 2 webcam" and "Derek webcam" are both folders that contain pictures captured by the same program on the same day.  However, "Micro 2 webcam" pictures were captured in Ball Hall 424 with the USB camera given to us.  Meanwhile, "Derek webcam" pictures were taken at Derek's house with his personal USB webcam.  It seems that the USB webcam given to us all is defective because it produces images that are green and purple.  The code seems functional though because it operates well with Derek's webcam attached instead of the other webcam.
