Description:
	This file is the first main program for Lab 2.
This program will be designed to match the specifications
layed out in the <<provided materials>> folder, and this
program will most likely resemble the skeleton code in
<<my-skeleton.c>>.

Example of Entry!!!
Name: Kyle Marescalchi
Date: 14-October-2017
Time: 19:00 - 20:00
Description: Implemented the required functions for the functions MSG_TURN[XXX], updated the required code for the 'PWM' delay output.

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 09-Oct-2017
Time: 1520 - 1555
Description: File created from skeleton; <<ADC_LED_Init>>
function coded from Lab 1; LED and ADC code in infinite
while loop copied from Lab 1 main code.

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 10-Oct-2017
Time: 1050 - 1315
Description: 	1) included files from Lab 1 main.c
				2) learned how the communication GPIO strobe signal is
					supposed to work.  Updated comments by removing
					<<7) GPIO Strobe Signal Implementation Uncertainty>>
					from the order of contents in the large opening comment.
				3) added in order of contents in large comment:
					<<7) How to implement GPIO stobe signal>>
				4) Added global variable, <<int last_ADC_value>> to keep
				track of the latest ADC vaue that was read for the LED.
				5) Coded GPIO_Init function; basically enables interrupts and
					sets inputs and outputs
				6) Changed name of interrupt function and coded it
				7) Added <<bits>> to end of register names
				8) Added DEBOUNCE_DELAY for on-change debouncing
				9) added HIGH and LOW constants
				10) added and coded read and write functions
				TO DO: Finish handling commands in switch-statement inside interrupt function
				TO DO: make adc right justified, but put entire 10-bit in int and always update global variable

INFORMATION

ORDER OF CONTENTS
	1) Note
	2) Pin Layout
	3) Writing procedure
	4) Reading procedure
	5) Safety note to avoid damaging devices
	6) Idea
	7) How to implement GPIO stobe signal

1) Note: When I say <<computer>>, I am referring to Intel
Galileo board running Linux Yocto.  And when I say <<PIC>>,
I am referring to PIC microcontroller, <<PIC16F18857>>.

2) Pins:
	PORTA:
		0: LED output
		1: ADC (light-sesnor) input
		2: PWM signal output
		3: PWM ON/OFF switch.
		4:
		5:
		6:
		7:

	PORTB:
		0: GPIO strobe input from computer
		1: GPIO data 0
		2: GPIO data 1
		3: GPIO data 2
		4: GPIO data 3
		5:
		6:
		7:

3) Writing Procedure (from computer to PIC)
	a) computer outputs 4-bit command
	b) computer raises GPIO strobe signal to HIGH, which triggers interrupt on the PIC
	c) the PIC reads what is being output; the output will only exist for 10ms so the PIC better fucking read it
	d) computer lowers strobe signal to low
	e) computer stops putting command on bus

4) Reading Procedure (from PIC to computer)
	a) computer pulls signal low
	b) PIC outputs 4-bit value (either MSG_ACK for fucking good or some of the god-damned ADC value)
	c) computer raises strobe signal to tell PIC that reading has begun
	d) computer puts strobe signal low again when done
	e) PIC stops outputting value

5) Safety Note to avoid damaging either device
The GPIO data bus pins should always be input on both devices (high impedance)
until the device is without doubt going to output data.  The concern in that
if both connected pins are low impedance and trying to write data, short circuits
may occur.  We cannot let this happen!
The GPIO strobe pin will always be output for the computer and input for the PIC.

6) Idea
One idea for if we are feeling like going above and beyond to to add
instructions a queue and remove them and execute in the main loop.
I have taken a look though, abnd I am not sure if this is possible
because some insyrcutions require immediate responses.

7) How to implement GPIO stobe signal
The PIC will not be sending messages unless it is respnding to an instruction.
When the GPIO signal goes high, an interrupt is triggered and a read operation is
performed.  The PIC processes the command and responds the correct number of times
before the PIC continues normal operation again.
