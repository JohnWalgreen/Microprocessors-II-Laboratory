Description:
	This file is the first main program for Lab 2.
This program will be designed to match the specifications
layed out in the <<provided materials>> folder, and this
program will most likely resemble the skeleton code in
<<my-skeleton.c>>.

Example of Entry!!!
Name: Joe Schmo
Date: 04-July-1977
Time: 0200 - 1523
Description: ... everything that was accomplished ...

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 09-Oct-2017
Time: 1520 - 1555
Description: File created from skeleton; <<ADC_LED_Init>>
function coded from Lab 1; LED and ADC code in infinite
while loop copied from Lab 1 main code.

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 10-Oct-2017
Time: 1050 - 1315
Description: 	1) included files from Lab 1 main.c
		2) learned how the communication GPIO strobe signal is
			supposed to work.  Updated comments by removing
			<<7) GPIO Strobe Signal Implementation Uncertainty>>
			from the order of contents in the large opening comment.
		3) added in order of contents in large comment:
			<<7) How to implement GPIO stobe signal>>
		4) Added global variable, <<int last_ADC_value>> to keep
			track of the latest ADC vaue that was read for the LED.
		5) Coded GPIO_Init function; basically enables interrupts and
			sets inputs and outputs
		6) Changed name of interrupt function and coded it
		7) Added <<bits>> to end of register names
		8) Added DEBOUNCE_DELAY for on-change debouncing
		9) added HIGH and LOW constants
		10) added and coded read and write functions
			TO DO: Finish handling commands in switch-statement inside interrupt function
			TO DO: make adc right justified, but put entire 10-bit in int and always update global variable

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 11-Oct-2017
Time: 1030-1050 & 1230 - 1500 & 1715 - 1748
Description: Worked on testing interrupt-on-change (in test interrupt.c program).  I have not been able to automatically
trigger interrupts, but I have been able to manually start an interrupt by setting an interrupt flag.  Still same TO DOs
as yesterday, and fix interrupt iniitialisations.  Also tried to get PWM stuff together.

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 13-Oct-2017
Time: 1020 - 1256
Description: 	1) modified interrupt test program and got it to work.  The problem might have been with ANSELx digital/analog
					input, but I am not sure.  I changed GPIO strobe interrupt code here to match what  test program has.
				2) Changed led latest value to adc_value global; changed adc to right justified to get full 10-bits
				3) Debounced ADC conversion by adding lower/upper thresholds for the LED enable.  Implemented via
					threshold+offset and threshold-offset.  Larger offsets allow for larger swings in light without LED
					flickers.

Name: Kyle Marescalchi
Date: 14-October-2017
Time: 19:00 - 20:00
Description: Implemented the required functions for the functions MSG_TURN[XXX], updated the required code for the 'PWM' delay output.

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 14-Oct-2017
Time: 2210 - 2226
Description: Fixed indentation in files, and I removed interrupt handler code that has not been tested (all in a big comment).  Got rid of test 
files that have not been started.

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 17-Oct-2017
Time: 1247 - 1319
Description:    ALL) Started working on communication.  Interrupt every time GPIO changes!
				1) Added negative-edge interrupt for GPIO RB0
				2) Added communication_counter global to handle what this particular interrupt is for
				3) Added instruction as global variable to maintain instruction in between interrupts
				4) ISSUE: debouncing properly involves distinguishing postive and negative interrupts
				5) Issue at bullet 4 fixed by looking at counter % 2
				6) write and read no longer change TRISB for GPIO pins
				7) FIX: write out proper values for adc in large switch statement
				
Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 20-Oct-2017
Time: 1030 - 1320 & night
Description:    1) Merge Kyle's PWM code with mine.
				2) fixed adc value 4-bit conversion for writing (used shift + and)
				3) initialise communication_counter global variable in gpio init
				4) TO DO:	- add more support for other instructions in execute
						- add file structure tree to help find what you are loking for
						- better comments for all prototypes
						- eliminate redundancy in PWM code
						- test
						- eliminate led_threshold and offset
							- instead, use min and max range variables that update.  They determine threshold.
						- is adc_value unsigned? it should be
						- average variable for adc? influence starts at 1
							- next influence = 1 / ((1 / influence) + 1)
							- next average = avg + influence * (new_value - avg)
						- can average vs. range/2 determine offset? Maybe offset is directly proportional to range?
						- does PWM need multiple square wave peaks? Does no signal move PWM to 0 degrees? If yes to last question, 
							how do we turn PWM on/off?
						- fix led +/-offset in code for proper debounce (< is fine)(< + offset is not fine)

Name: Hans-Edward Hoene
Date: 22-Oct-2017
Time: 1600 - 1959
Description:	1) Made threshold dynamic
				2) Got rid of execute function and just put it in main
				3) Eliminated redundant PWM code
				4) Referenced ANSELA in PWM init to select digital output
				5) RA3 no longer needed to disable/enable PWM motor.
				6) Fixed communication error. I forgot to write back MSG_ACK when adc bits were done sending.

Name: Kyle Marescalchi
Date: 22-Oct-2017
Time: 1715 - 1750
Description:	1) Got PWM functios to work.
				2) Discovered that PWM requires +6V for power supply.
				3) Discovered that 0% duty cycle triggers no movement, so RA3 was no longer needed.

INFORMATION

ORDER OF CONTENTS
	1) Note
	2) Pin Layout
	3) Writing procedure
	4) Reading procedure
	5) Safety note to avoid damaging devices
	6) Idea
	7) How to implement GPIO stobe signal

1) Note: When I say <<computer>>, I am referring to Intel
Galileo board running Linux Yocto.  And when I say <<PIC>>,
I am referring to PIC microcontroller, <<PIC16F18857>>.

2) Pins:
	PORTA:
		0: LED output
		1: ADC (light-sesnor) input
		2: PWM signal output
		3: 
		4:
		5:
		6:
		7:

	PORTB:
		0: BROKEN PORT!!!!!!! RIP - will be missed (shoutout to Derek)
		1: GPIO data 0
		2: GPIO data 1
		3: GPIO data 2
		4: GPIO data 3
		5: GPIO strobe input
		6: NEVER USE!
		7: NEVER USE!

3) Writing Procedure (from computer to PIC)
	a) computer outputs 4-bit command
	b) computer raises GPIO strobe signal to HIGH, which triggers interrupt on the PIC
	c) the PIC reads what is being output; the output will only exist for 10ms so the PIC better fucking read it
	d) computer lowers strobe signal to low
	e) computer stops putting command on bus

4) Reading Procedure (from PIC to computer)
	a) computer pulls signal low
	b) PIC outputs 4-bit value (either MSG_ACK for fucking good or some of the god-damned ADC value)
	c) computer raises strobe signal to tell PIC that reading has begun
	d) computer puts strobe signal low again when done
	e) PIC stops outputting value

5) Safety Note to avoid damaging either device
The GPIO data bus pins should always be input on both devices (high impedance)
until the device is without doubt going to output data.  The concern in that
if both connected pins are low impedance and trying to write data, short circuits
may occur.  We cannot let this happen!
The GPIO strobe pin will always be output for the computer and input for the PIC.

6) Idea
One idea for if we are feeling like going above and beyond to to add
instructions a queue and remove them and execute in the main loop.
I have taken a look though, abnd I am not sure if this is possible
because some insyrcutions require immediate responses.

7) How to implement GPIO stobe signal
The PIC will not be sending messages unless it is respnding to an instruction.
When the GPIO signal goes high, an interrupt is triggered and a read operation is
performed.  The PIC processes the command and responds the correct number of times
before the PIC continues normal operation again.
